    <p>  <em>  These potatoes are meant as a side dish for your steak.. a perfect compliment. </em> </p>
    <h1> Ingredients: </h1>
    <ul> 
        <li>  4 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced </li> 

        <li>  1 medium onion, sliced into rings </li> 
            
        <li>  salt and ground black pepper to taste </li> 
            
        <li>  3 tablespoons butter </li> 
            
        <li>  3 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li> 
            
        <li>  ½ teaspoon salt </li> 
            
        <li>  2 cups milk </li> 
            
        <li>  1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese </li> 
    </ul>
    <h1> Steps: </h1> 
    <ol> 
        <li> Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish. </li>
        <li> Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li> Layer onion slices over top, then top with with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li> Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual addition and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce. </li>
        <li> Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly, about 1 ½ hours. </li>
    </ol>
